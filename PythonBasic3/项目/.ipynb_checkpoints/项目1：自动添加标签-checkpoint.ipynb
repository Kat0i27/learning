    "你要给纯文本文件添加格式。假设你要将一个文件用作网页，而给你文件的人嫌麻烦，没有以HTML格式编写它。你不想手工添加需要的所有标签，想编写一个程序来自动完成这项工作。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 功能分析\n",
    "1. 输入无需包含人工编码或标签。\n",
    "2. 程序需要能够处理不同的文本块（如标题、段落和列表项）以及内嵌文本（如突出的文本和URL）。\n",
    "3. 虽然这个实现添加的是HTML标签，但应该很容易对其进行扩展，以支持其他标记语言。\n",

    "### 工具分析\n",
    "- 肯定需要读写文件（参见第11章），至少要从标准输入（sys.stdin）读取以及使用print进行输出。\n",
    "- 可能需要迭代输入行（参见第11章）\n",
    "- 需要使用一些字符串方法（参见第3章）。\n",
    "- 可能用到一两个生成器（参见第9章）。\n",
    "- 可能需要模块re（参见第10章）。\n",
    " 如果你不熟悉上述任何概念，请花点时间复习一下。"
